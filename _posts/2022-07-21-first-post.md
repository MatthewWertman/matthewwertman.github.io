This is my first post!

I have had this idea for a while now and I am very excited to actually do it! If you havent already, be sure to check out the About tab. In short, I wanted to start writing about my learnings and personal projects that I am working on. Hopefully I can provide some insight on what I am learning and my thought process. Maybe can even help someone else having a similar problem/idea.

I jump around a lot when it comes to projects, and my projects span over many different areas. Which I think works well of a blog-like environemnt like this!

Some topics that I expect to cover heavily:
 - Linux
 - Shell-scripting
 - Game/Mod Development
 - Software/Tools
 - Node
 - Self-Hosting/Homelab server

But of course, Thats not all! I plan to cover basically whatever I am currently learning, developing, or thinking about.

Anyway, That's it for now.
See you soon. :)
